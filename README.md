# Death Swap

Made for Minecraft 1.21.1. To start, with everyone online run `/function deathswap:load` and then run `/function deathswap:start`, everything else is automatic.'
You may experience a fair amount of lag when starting, this is because of the `spreadplayers` command, the lag will disappear after a few seconds.

To add a late joiner, run `/scoreboard players add #players players 1`.
To uninstall run `/function deathswap:uninstall`.
